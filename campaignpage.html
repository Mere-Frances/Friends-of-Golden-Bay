            <p>In 2001 the Environment Court directed that aquaculture expansion in Golden Bay should be carried out 3
                km
                offshore, where it would be out of sight.  A special temporary exception was allowed for the existing
                farm
                in Wainui Bay until 2012, and was subsequently extended until 2024.  Despite the Environment court’s
                ruling
                TDC granted an application in 2016 that would effectively have converted the Wainui farm into a
                permanent
                operation.  Several parties, including Friends of Golden Bay, successfully appealed that decision in the
                Environment Court.  So we still have the chance that this magnificent scenery will one day again enjoy

            <h4>Nitrate levels</h4>
            <p>Nitrate is a small, simple molecule that is soluble in water. (more info) It occurs naturally in rivers
                and lakes at low levels. Human activity, notably farming and disposal of treated sewage, can greatly
                increase those levels. Friends of Golden Bay has been monitoring the nitrate levels at three sites in Te
                Waikoropupū Springs Reserve for over four years. The graph below shows the nitrate levels in Te
                Waikoropupū Main Spring, and Fish Spring, from February 2016 to the present. (Updated 4 Apr 2024.) The
                units are milligrams of nitrate-N per litre (mg/l). <br><br>

                <h4>Faecal Bacteria</h4>
                <p>
                    High levels of bacterial pollution from cattle are flowing into Te Waikoropupū Reserve. The
                    pollution
                    mixes with the waters of Fish Spring and travels via Fish Creek right through the Reserve. Bacterial
                    counts are often in the tens of thousands, meaning that contact with the water would be hazardous.
                    Many
                    varieties of faecal bacteria are harmless, but some are not. If those ones are picked up by people
                    they
                    can cause anything from diarrhoea to death (remember Havelock) so they are to be taken seriously. We
                    say
                    it’s a disgrace to pollute our national treasures like this, and it reflects badly on the dairy
                    industry
                    as a whole. The table below summarises our test results. Units of E.coli are MPN / 100 ml. Figures
                    in
                    red are above the recreational guideline. For each sampling occasion we include the rainfall over
                    the
                    previous 12 hours and a brief comment on the conditions at the time.<br><br>
